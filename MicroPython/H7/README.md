Copy the main.py from this director to the H7 flash drive to boot it with REPL enabled. This way you can access it from another uartremote device and upload scripts.

Copy uartremote.py from one directory above to the flash drive too.

The uartremote.mpy from the SPIKE directory will probably work too.
